## Here's my first post!


Felt like refactoring my website to make it easier to write blog posts and record my experiences at this point in my career. Now, the blog posts can have simple tags and are all written in full markdown, so the styling is customizable and real easy.

Currently, I plan on updating this site with tidbits on what I've learned, and the projects I've completed as a part of my portfolio. I plan on writing each project in a blog post and apply the "project" tag to them.

Thanks for checking this site out! If you have any questions or want to contact me, all the information you need is on the Contact page!
