## We're so back?


I stopped even thinking about this site in last May. Truthfully, I was approached for an awesome job at a great company around early June, and am still working there today.

Something that my employer has really emphasized is leaning into our professional development, which is something I oft neglected after getting hired. Turns out, it's extremely easy to get complacent once you've achieved one of your goals.

What I'm looking to do is twofold:

1. Updating the site, maybe weekly with something I've learned or a thought I've had about things ranging from engineering to a random tangent. Doing something is better than nothing, I suppose

2. Working on a project to help track goals. Currently, I have 3 requirements in mind, in order of :
- Functions to set a goal, set an end date, make posts/updates to the goal with progress
- Add login functionality and incorporate the ability to save updates
- Add a GUI

This will be good practice for writing an API, manipulating HTTP calls, authentication and design. And I'll be the only user on it B) 

Thanks for reading!
