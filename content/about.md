I'm Christian, a software engineer currently living in the Atlanta area. I've been studying programming for 6 years now, and I'm looking for an opportunity to contribute to your team!

My main programming tools are Go and Python - I have enjoy building small scripts, single page applications, testing suites and bots for the online chat and community service Discord. I try and approach these problems by writing the most efficient and beautiful code possible. 

I'm getting married in October of this year, and in my spare time I love cooking and  playing video games!

Thank you for checking out my website. Feel free to reach out to speak about any opportunities you may have. I hope you consider making me a part of your team!
