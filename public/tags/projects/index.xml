      <description>Getting hired is hard. I&amp;rsquo;ve been applying to software jobs (at least 5 good ones per day) for about a month now, having graduated with a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in comp sci. So far, it&amp;rsquo;s been less than stellar.
The answer is simply to keep applying, but being faced with this reality is certainly disappointing - after all, starting what I view as my long-term career and securing financial stability is a dream that I share with millions of other new college grads.</description>
