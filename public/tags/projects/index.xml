      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;were-so-back&#34;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re so back?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped even thinking about this site in last May. Truthfully, I was approached for an awesome job at a great company around early June, and am still working there today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that my employer has really emphasized is leaning into our professional development, which is something I oft neglected after getting hired. Turns out, it&amp;rsquo;s extremely easy to get complacent once you&amp;rsquo;ve achieved one of your goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-hired-is-hard&#34;&gt;Getting hired is hard.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been applying to software jobs (at least 5 good ones per day) for about a month now, having graduated with a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in comp sci. So far, it&amp;rsquo;s been less than stellar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simply to keep applying, but being faced with this reality is certainly disappointing - after all, starting what I view as my long-term career and securing financial stability is a dream that I share with millions of other new college grads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
